# Voice-Cloning
File 1: Training Indian Accent.ipynb:
This File contains code for training encoder Model on the Indian Accent Dataset. The Data set used in it is the Indic TTS Dataset. If you require to use a different Dataset in the future you should match the folder structure of the Indic TTS Dataset which is set as /content/Datasets/Hindi_Dataset/speakers/*.wav.
Download the trained model and then upload it on drive in the folder MyDrive/Indian_accent/Models

File 2: Interference.ipynb: This File generates output from the pretrained models that are downloaded from the site(synthesiser and vocoder) and trained by the Training Indian Accent.ipynb file. This file requires you to input text and input voice that needs to be cloned.

Alternatives:
There is a separate installation for voice cloning and tts which can also be used as an alternative
Refer: https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
There is another file for this named Alternative.ipynb
